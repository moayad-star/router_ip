# NOTE 


* Make sure you are close to the network 
* The links will be displayed directly on the terminal, but the tool will not end until after a deep examination, so it will take about 5 minutes to complete 


# common problems 

* Sometimes you find strange web pages, you should not ignore them, as it is a problem of the interference of external services with internal services
